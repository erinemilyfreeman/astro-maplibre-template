        - str: This atlas begins as a response to the redistricting in the state of Wisconsin in February 2024.  Prior to February 2024, Wisconsin had curiously drawn districts and other oddities associated with the state’s extreme gerrymandering.  A state Supreme Court decision forced Wisconsin Republicans to cede an advantage they had for more than a decade.  Thus, these oddities were erased in new voting maps passed by the Wisconsin Legislature.  On February 19, 2024, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers signed the redistricting legislation into law stating that, “Wisconsin is not a red state; it is not a blue state; Wisconsin is a purple state.”
